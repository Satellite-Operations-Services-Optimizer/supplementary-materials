our updates
setting up servers

plan for this week
basic front end
framework set up

what are expectations milestones
	iterative depends on how you set up
	maybe share sprints yes or maybe not right dir
	depends on you - propose what you want 
	we'll say valid or not, provide guidance

what about at the end of the project
good solution would be
	front end: view status from gs, satellite status - available storage, power, position , order status
	system: efficiently allocates /schedule distributed schedule
	reallocate tasks not lose activities
 
what are your priority on deliverables viewing status or backend algorithms 
	look at project milestones and decide what to focus your resources on
	we don't have a set outcome
	might be better to work on seperate services rather than one ui
	you can work on aspects and we'll give feedbak and iterate and have a back and forth. pretend we don't really know what we want and

Expectations new weekly inputs coming in will we have a new expectation in january 
	you don't have all the expectaions right now, we'll keeep asking or adding to see 	how system will react to the different cases and activities

technical optimizing - number of requests we can except to recieve
	100 per day per spacecraft - is idealized range
	either batchdrop or spreadout

load balancer 
	see how system performs first before thinking about scalability. see how it performs on a smaller scale. figure out limitations first you might think one will be a bottle neck but find a different one.

will send package with 50 sample orders.
